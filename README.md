# CNN Projects

This repository contains my projects related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These projects were created to learn and improve my skills in deep learning and computer vision using PyTorch.

## Project Overview

| Project Name       | Dataset         | Date       |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Fashion-MNIST CNN  | Fashion-MNIST   | November 2024 |
| CIFAR-10 CNN       | CIFAR-10        | Planned    |

## Details

### Fashion-MNIST CNN
- **Dataset:** Fashion-MNIST
- **Description:** A simple CNN trained to classify clothing and footwear images into 10 categories.
- **Tools Used:** PyTorch, torchvision
- **Status:** Completed

### CIFAR-10 CNN
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10
- **Description:** A CNN project aimed at classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, cats, etc.).
- **Tools Used:** PyTorch, torchvision
- **Status:** In Progress

## Future Plans
- Improve model accuracy using advanced techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning.
- Explore more complex datasets like ImageNet or COCO.
- Add deployment examples (e.g., model served via a web API).

Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback!
